click on the forecast
- If we want some more information about what's going on today we can click on the forecast button and see some additional information including the high and low for today as well as the sunrise and sunset time

type in the zipcode in the search bar
- we can also use the searchbar to search using a zipcode and see all the same functionality

show code briefly and explain what each function is doing
- We have two separate functions and with this project I was able to learn more about using api's and I learned how to use this certain type of request using the options and giving it the things I want to get from the API
